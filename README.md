Charity Connect is a MVC MongoDB web application that allows users to search for charities by the cause. Additionally, if a user wants to save a particular charity, they can store it in their "favorites" list.
I created Charity Connect because I know that many people, including myself, feel themselves wanting to give back, but they don't know where to start. Charity Connect eases the pressure of finding reliable organizations, as it sources its information through an API called OrgHunter. According to its website, OrgHunter pulls information from the entire database of IRS-registered nonprofits.

First, users are greeted with a welcoming page and an option to sign up for an account or log in to an existing account.

Then, users are directed to a search page, in which they can search for organizations based on what type of charity they are interested it. For example, they could search the word "animal," "humane," or "cancer."

Search results are returned to the user, displaying charities' name, location, OrgHunter donation link and category. From there, users can add a charity to their favorites list by hovering over and clicking the star icon. The favorites page displays a list of every favorited charity associated with that user.

Finally, users can delete a charity from their list by clikcing the X icon. 

In the future, I could add more features to Charity Connect, like a user log of how much they have donated to each charity. Happy browsing!
